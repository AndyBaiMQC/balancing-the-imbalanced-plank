# balancing-the-imbalanced-plank
Quickfire project that tries to solve imbalanced small dataset image classifications. Implemented the train engine and evaluation functions myself without using high-level APIs.

Please find the following:
	
	Source code - /src
	Report - report.pdf
	Model - trained_network.pth
	ONNX model - fcn.onnx

To rerun the experiments, navigate to /src and type:

	bash run.sh

If you have most dependencies installed, simply:

	python3 run.py

To launch from the root directory:

	cd src
	bash run.sh #python3 run.py
